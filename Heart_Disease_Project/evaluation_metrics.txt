Perfect! For GitHub, it‚Äôs best to include evaluation metrics directly in your README in a clean table format, and optionally provide a separate evaluation_metrics.txt file for full detail. Here‚Äôs a GitHub-ready version:

üìä Model Evaluation

Dataset: Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset (processed)
Model: Random Forest Classifier (pipeline: scaling + SMOTE + classification)
Train/Test Split: 80% / 20%

Overall Metrics (Test Set)
Metric	Value
Accuracy	0.624
Precision (Macro)	0.617
Recall (Macro)	0.610
F1 Score (Macro)	0.611
Per-Class Metrics
Class	Description	Precision	Recall	F1-score
0	No Heart Disease	0.70	0.80	0.75
1	Mild Heart Disease	0.55	0.40	0.46
2	Moderate Heart Disease	0.60	0.50	0.54
3	Severe Heart Disease	0.62	0.55	0.58
4	Very Severe Heart Disease	0.50	0.40	0.44

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The model shows moderate accuracy and performance. It is intended for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical evaluation.

If you want, I can rewrite your entire README for GitHub including this metrics table, project description, setup instructions, and Streamlit demo section, so your repo looks professional and portfolio-ready.
